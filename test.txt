Use php artisan to create necessary files.
I am building an API for an ecommerce app. I have implemented authentication and authorization using Laravel Sanctum.

TODO:

Update the `DatabaseSeeder.php` file to add 15 products. Should be of varying categories. Include at least 2 images for each product. Some should be featured. Some should have discounts.

Sample Product:
`
{
    "name": "MacBook Pro 16-inch",
    "description": "The MacBook Pro 16-inch with Apple M1 Pro chip, 16GB RAM, and a 1TB SSD, designed for professional-grade performance and stunning visuals.",
    "price": 2499.00,
    "discountedPrice": 2299.99,
    "categoryId": 3,
    "stock": 15,
    "featured": true,
    "imageUrls": [
        "https://store.storeimages.cdn-apple.com/8756/as-images.apple.com/is/refurb-mbp16-space-m1-2021?wid=2000&hei=2000&fmt=jpeg&qlt=90&.v=1643239951000",
        "https://sm.pcmag.com/t/pcmag_me/review/a/apple-macb/apple-macbook-pro-16-inch-2023-m3-max_cah1.1920.jpg"
    ]
}
`

Include the sample product as well.
